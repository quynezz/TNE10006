**Seven attributes of subnetting**

Addtional attributes may include `The number of subnet that the current IP is in` and `How many subnet with the same size can we create`

```Example
192.168.1.0 /24 => 255.255.255.0
11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000

Number of subnets: 2^subnet bits
Number of hosts: 2^host bits
Number of usable hosts: 2^host bits - 2

What size => CIDR 
How many => number of host
```
