+ Router interfaces have the `shutdown` command applied by default => the `status` and `protocal` will be `administratively down` and `down` by default.
+ Switch interface do **NOT** have the `shutdown` command applied by default => the `status` and `protocol` will be in `up` and `up` state if connected to other device or `down` and `down` if not connected to other device.

There are 2 important command `show ip int br` and `show int status`

For the `interface status`:
+ `Name`: is the description
+ `Duplex`: Auto means that Cisco device will negotiate full-duplex whenever possible.
+ `Speed`: Auto means that Cisco device will negotiate the highest speed the connected device can be.

`Half-Duplex`: means the device cannot send and receive data at the same time. If it is receiving a frame, it must wait before sending a frame

`Full-Duplex`: means the device can send and receive data at the same time. It does not have to wait.

There are two basic access control methods for shared media:

**Contention-based access** : Where all nodes are operating in half-duplex, competing for the use of the medium. However, only one device can send at a time. Therefore, methods are required to handle this:

- **Carrier sense multiple access with collision detection (CSMA/CD)** used on legacy bus-topology Ethernet LANs

- **Carrier sense mutiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA)** on wireless LANs

**Controlled access**: each node has to wait for their turn to access the network medium

**CSMA/CD**:

If two devices transmit at the same time, a collision will occur. For legacy Ethernet LANs, both devices will detect the collision on the network. This is the collision detection(CD) portion of CSMA/CD.

The NIC compares data transmitted with data received, or by recognizing that the signal amplitude is higher than normal on the media. The data sent by both devices will be corrupted and will need to be resent.

**CSMA/CA**

CMSA/CA uses a method similar to CSMA/CD to detect if the media is clear. CMSA/CA uses additional techniques. In wireless environments it may not be possible for a device to detect a collision. CMSA/CA does not detect collisions but attempts to avoid them by waiting before transmitting.

device that transmits includes the time duration that it needs for the transmission. All other wireless devices receive this information and know how long the medium will be unavailable.


#### C. Speed/Duplex Autonegotiation
Interfaces that can run at different speeds (10/100 or 10/100/1000) have default settings of `speed auto` and `duplex auto`.

Interface `advertise` their capabilities to the neighboring device, and they negotiate the best `speed` and `duplex` settings they are both capable of.

`=> What if autonegotiation is disabled on the device connected to the switch`

+ `Speed`: The switch will try to sense the speed that the other device is operating at, if it fails to sense the speed, it will use the slowest supported speed (10 Mbps on a 10/100/1000 interface).
+ `Duplex`: If the speed is 10 or 100 Mbps, the switch will use half duplex. If the speed is 1000 Mbps or greater, use full duplex.
