#### A. Routing Fundamentals
(+) `Routing` is the process that routers use to determine the path that IP Packets should take over a network to reach their destination.
	(-) Routers store routes to all of their know destination in a `routing table`
	(-) When routers receive packets, they look in the `routing table` to find the best route to forward that packet.

(+) There are two main routing methods:
	(-) `Dynamic Routing`: Routers se dynamic routing protocols (OSPF) to share routing information with each other automatically and build their routing tables
	(-) `Static Routing`: A network engineer/admin configures routers on the router.

`NOTE:`
(+) When a packet is received at the router, there are 2 mains reason:
	`(1)` This packet is for the router, hence there needs to be a way for the router to know this packet is for itself, this is done by the local route (/32 for the exact IP)
	`(2)` This packet is for hosts that connected to the router, hence there needs to be a way for the router to know this packet is for the connected hosts, this is done by the connected route (subnet mask of the connected networks)

```Example
(+) A Packet destined for 192.168.1.1 is matched by both routes
	192.168.1.0/24 and 192.168.1.1/32

==> In this case the router will choose the most specific matching route

(+) The route to 192.168.1.0/24 includes 256 differents IP addresses (192.168.1.0 -> 192.168.1.255)
(+) The route to 192.168.1.1/32 include only 1 IP address

==> Therefore, the router will chose /32 as it is more specific, hence the use of local routes in the routing table.
```

#### B. Routes to remote network
(+) End hosts can send packets directly to destinations in their connected network.
(+) End host needs to send packets to their `default gateway` if it wants to send packets to foreign network.

==> In a remote network transmission, End hosts will send the packet to its default gateway first, no matter what the IP address is. So the packet will have the following:

```
Src. IP: Sender's IP (Sender's IP is the first sender and does not change)
Dst. IP: Receiver's IP (End-to-End)
Src. MAC: Sender's MAC (Sender's MAC is the device sending packet and can be changed at each hop)
Dst. MAC: Default Gateway's MAC (Hop-to-Hop)
```

`NOTE`
(+) Instead of specifying the next-hop using IP address, we can also use the exit interface, that is instead of using `ip route + <ip-address> + <mask> + <next-hop's IP address>` we can use `ip route + <ip-address> + <mask> + <the interface>` Or we can combine them both

#### C. Default Route
(+) A `Default Route` is a route to `0.0.0.0/0`, it is the `least specific route` possible, this can be use to direct any transmission to the internet. This works because
	(-) Routing is done from the most specific to the least specific, so internal routing will take precedence over external routing.

In the picture above, `Gateway of last resort` refers to default route and it is not configured yet. To do this `ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.2`
