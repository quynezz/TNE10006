(+) Floating Static Route is set up as a back up route for the main route, FSR will have a higher metric than the main route (so that the main route is preferred) and if the main route is down, router will use FSR as a backup.

#### A. How to set up Floating Static Route
(+) Observe the current routing protocol and identify the AD of the protocol.
(+) Configure the second route so that the second route's AD is lower than the main route. For example if the main route's AD is 110 for OSPF then we should `ip route <DEST IP> <DEST MASK> <ROUTE> <Lower Metric (90 in this case)>`
(+) We can test the secondary route by `shutdown` the main route interface or use `tracert + <IP>` on the PC>
