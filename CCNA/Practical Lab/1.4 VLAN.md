#### To view VLAN information
(+) `show vlan brief`: to show the summary of VLAN
![[Pasted image 20231228145639.png]]

#### To configure switch port
(+) `interface range <range>`: group interface for configuring
(+) `switchport mode access`: assign the range as access port, access port is a switchport which belongs to a single VLAN, and usually connects to end hosts like PCS.
(+) `switchport access VLAN 10`: assign the interfaces range to VLAN 10.
(+) `name + <Name for the vlan>`: assign specific name for the vlan.

#### To configure trunk port 
(+) `interface + <interface>`: enter the interface
(+) `switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q`: enable dot1q for the interface
(+) `switchport mode trunk`: enable trunking on the interface.

`NOTE`:
(+) For devices which support both dot1q and ISL, when we use `switchport mode trunk` errors may occur

==> This is because the devices can support both encapsulation protocols and it does not know which to use, so we need to specifies the protocol using `switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q` to solve this.

==> For devices which only support dot1q, this may not be a problem.

(+) `switchport trunk allow vlan`: To allow which VLAN can go through the trunk port.

#### To show information about trunking
(+) `show interface trunk`: Show trunking information

#### To change native VLAN
(+) `switch port trunk native vlan 1001`: change native VLAN

#### To configure Router On A Stick (ROAS)
(+) `interface + <Interface>`: we only need one interface as it will be encapsulated with dot1q for multiple vlans transmission.
	=> However, the interface must be assign with a VLAN tag to distinguish itself from others `int g0/0.10` for VLAN 10 or `int g0/0.20` for VLAN 20
(+) `encapsulation dot1q 10`: enable dot1q encap for the interface with the corresponding VLAN
(+) `ip address + <address> + <mask>`: assign ip address and mask for the sub-interfaces.

The route will be similar but with the VLAN tag behind

#### Routing on L3 switch

(+) `ip routing`: enables L3 routing on the switch.
(+) `interface + <interface>`: enter the interface configuration
(+) `no switchport`: configure the interface as a `routed port` not a `switchport` meaning `L3 port` not `L2 port`
(+) `ip address + <address> + <mask>`: assign the address for the interface
(+) `ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 + <next hop>`: to configure the default route for external routing.
v
==> After that we need to creates SVIs on switch, this is done by creating VLANs, assign them IPs, and enable them. Interfaces on switch are up/up by default but not the SVIs.
