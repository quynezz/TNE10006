(+) `show ip route`: Used to view the routing table

`NOTE:`
(+) When a packet is received at the router, there are 2 mains reason:
	`(1)` This packet is for the router, hence there needs to be a way for the router to know this packet is for itself, this is done by the local route (/32 for the exact IP)
	`(2)` This packet is for hosts that connected to the router, hence there needs to be a way for the router to know this packet is for the connected hosts, this is done by the connected route (subnet mask of the connected networks)


(+) `ip route + <ip-address> + <netmask> + <next-hop>`

`NOTE`
(+) Instead of specifying the next-hop using IP address, we can also use the exit interface, that is instead of using `ip route + <ip-address> + <mask> + <next-hop's IP address>` we can use `ip route + <ip-address> + <mask> + <the interface>` Or we can combine them both.

(+) `ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 + <next-hop>`: for configuring default route.

(+) For better bug fixing we can use `pipeline command |`: `show running-config | include ip route` to get all the ip route command that has been configured
