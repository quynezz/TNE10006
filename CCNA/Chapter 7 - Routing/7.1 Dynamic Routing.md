(+) `Network route`: A route to a network/subnet (mask length < /32)
(+) `Host route`: A route to a specific host (/32 mask)

#### A. Dynamic Routing Protocol
![[Pasted image 20240115163131.png]]

(+) Routers can use `dynamic routing protocols` to advertise information about the routes they know to other routes.
(+) They form `adjacencies or neighborships` with adjacent routers to exchange this information.
(+) If multiple routes to a destination are learned, the router determines which route is superior and adds it to the routing table.

#### B. Types of Dynamic Routing Protocol
(+) Dynamic routing protocols can be divided into two main categories: `Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)` or `Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP)`.
(+) `IGP` is used to share routes within a single `autonomous system (AS)`, which is a single organization (a company).
(+) `EGP` is used to share routes between different autonomous system.

(+) `IGP` can be further divided into algorithm type of `distance vector` and `link state`. 
(+) `EGP` can be further divided into algorithm type of `Path Vector` and the currently and only using protocol is the `Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)`.

###### 1. Distance Vector Routing Protocols
(+) Distance vector protocols were invented before link state protocols.
(+) Early example are `Routing Information Protocol (RIPv1)` and Cisco's proprietary protocol `Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (IGRP)` and later updated to `Enhanced Interiror Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)`.
(+) Distance vector protocols operate by sending the following to their directly connected neighbors: `Their known destination network` and `their metric to reach their known destination network`.
(+) This method of sharing route information is often called `routing by rumor`. Because the router doesnt know about the network beyond its neighbors. It only knows the information that its neighbors tell it.
(+) Called `distance vector` because the routers only learn the `distance (metric)` and `vector (direction, the next-hop router)` of each route.

###### 2. Link State Routing Protocols
(+) When using a `link state` routing protocols, every router creates a `connectivity map` of the network.
(+) To allow this, each router advertises information about its interfaces (connected networks) to its neighbors. These advertisements are passed along to other router, until all routers in the network develop the same map of the network.
(+) Each router independently uses this map to calculate the best routes to each destination.
(+) Link state protocols use more resources (CPU) on the router, because more information is shared.
(+) However, link state protocols tend to be faster in reacting to changes in the network than distance vector protocols.

###### 3. Dynamic Routing Protocols Metrics
(+) A router's route table contains the best route to each destination network it knows about.
(+) If a router using a dynamic routing protocols learn two different routes to the same destination, it uses the metric value of the routes to determine which is the best. (lower metric means better)
(+) Each routing protocol uses a different metrict to determine which route is the best.
==> If the router learns two (or more) routes via the `same routing protocol` to the `same destination` with the `same metric`, both will be added to the routing table and the traffic will be load-balanced over both routes.  Also known as `Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP)`

`Note`:
(+) The `Administrative Distance (AD)` and the `Equal Cost Multi-Path (ECMP)` of static route is 1 and 0.

(+) `Routing Information Protocol (RIP)` uses hop-count as metric.
(+) `Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)` uses calculation based on bandwidth and delay.
(+) `Open Shortest Path First (OSPF)` uses the cost of each link based on bandwith.
(+) `Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS)` uses the cost of each link but the cost is 10 by default.

###### 4. Administrative Distance (AD)
 (+) In most case a company will only use a single IGP - usually OSPF or EIGRP. However, in some rare cases they might use two.
 (+) Metric is used to comapre routes `learned via the same routing protocol`, however, for different routing protocols, it uses different metrics, hence can not be compared.
 (+) The `administrative distance (AD)` is used to determine which routing protocol is prefered.
![[Pasted image 20240117111936.png]]

==> We can change the value of AD for routes and routing protocol using `ip address <IP> <Mask> <AD value>`

###### 5. Floating Static Routes
(+) By changing the AD of a static route, you can make it less preferred than routes learned by a dynamic routing protocol to the same destination (make sure the AD is higher than the routing protocol's AD). This is called `floating static rotue`.
(+) The route will be inactive (not in the routing table but function as a backup route) unless the route learned by the dynamic routing protocol is removed (for example, the remote router stops advertising it for some reason, or an interface failure causes an adjacency with a neighbor to be lost).

`Note:`
(+) If we receives `routes from multiple routing protocols` to the `same destination`, you use the `Administrative Distance (AD)` to select the route.
(+) If we get `routes from the same routing protocol` to the `same destination`, you use the `metric`.
(+) But if we route to multiple `destination` then `AD and metric are irrelevant`, we should chose the route that is `most specific`.
