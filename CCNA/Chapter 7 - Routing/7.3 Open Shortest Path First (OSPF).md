#### A. What is OSPF
(+) OSPF is a `link state` routing protocol, every router creates a `connectivity map` of the network. 
(+) Uses the `shortest path first` algorithm of Dutch computer scientist aka `Dijkstra's algorithm`.
(+) OSPFv2 is commonly used for IPv4
(+) Routers store information about the network in `Link State Advertisements (LSAs)` which are organized in a structure called the `Link State Database (LSDB)`. 
(+) Router will `flood` LSAs until all routers in the `OSPF` area develop the same map of the network `LSDB`.

###### 1. LSA Flooding
![[Pasted image 20240119155736 1.png| 600]]

(+) `OSPF` is enabled on R4's G1/0 Interface, R4 will creates an LSA to tell its neighbors about the network on G1/0.
(+) LSA consists of a `router ID (RID)`, `IP` and `Cost`. LSDB contains multiple LSA.
(+) The LSA is flooded throughout the network untill all routers have received it. This result in all routers sharing the same LSDB.
(+) Each router then uses the SPF algorithm to calculate its best route to `192.168.4.0/24`
(+) Each LSA has an aging timer (30 min by default). The LSA will be flooded again should this timer expires.

`Summary`:
(1) Become neighbors with other routers connected to the same segment.
(2) Exchange LSAs with neighbor routers.
(3) Calculate the best routes to each destination, and insert them into the routing table.

#### B. OSPF Areas
(+) OSPF uses `areas` to divide up the network, which is small networks that can be `single-area` without any negative effects on performance.
(+) In larger networks, a single-area design can have negatie effects:
	(-) The SPF algorithm takes more time to calculate routes.
	(-) The SPF algorithm requires exponentially more processing power on the router
	(-) The larger LSDB taks up more memory on the routers.
	(-) Any small change in the network causes every router to flod LSAs and run the SPF algorithm again.
(+) By dividing a larger OSPF network into several smaller areas, you can avoid the above negative effects.

###### 1. OSPF Properties
(+) An `area` is a set of routers and links that share the same LSDB.
(+) The `backbone area` is an area that all other areas must connect to.
(+) Routers with all interfaces in the same area are called `internal routers`
(+) Routers with  interfaces in multiple areas are called `area border routers (ABRs)`.
(+) Routers connected to the backbone area (area 0) are called `backbone routers`.
(+) An `intra-area route` is a route to a destination inside the same OSPF area.
(+) An `interarea route` is a route to a destination in a different OSPF area.

==> ABRs maintain a separate LSDB for each area they are connected to. It is recommended that you connect an ABR to a maximum of 2 areas. Connecting an ABR to 3+ areas can overburden the router.

###### 2. OSPF Rules
(+) OSPF areas should be `contiguous`, meaning that each individual area should be connected, not divided up. The picture below is a `discontiguous` network as area 1 is divided into to different section.
![[Pasted image 20240120134559.png | 500]]

(+) All OSPF areas must have at least `one ABR` connected to the backbone area. The below network is an anti-pattern of this rule
![[Pasted image 20240120134826.png | 500]]

(+) OSPF interfaces in the same subnet must be in the same area. In the below example, the router with address of `192.168.1.2/29` although in the same subnet as others in area 0, it would not be OSPF neighbors with others router as it is not in the same area.

![[Pasted image 20240120135047.png | 500]]

###### 3. Basic OSPF Configuration.
(+) `router ospf + <process id>`: As a router can run multiple OSPF processes at once, and this ID is used in the router to identify them. The OSPF `process id` is `locally significant`. Router with different process IDs can be come OSPF neighbors.
(+) `network + <ip> + <wildcard mask> + <area>`: `netowrk 10.0.12.0 0.0.0.3 area 0` for example.
(+) `network 10.0.13.0 0.0.0.3 area 0`:
(+) `network 172.16.1.0 0.0.0.15 area 0`
(+) `passive-interface g2/0`: stop sending OSPF `hello` message out of the interface.
(+) `default-information originate`: create a LSA about default route to its neighbors.
(+) `clear ip ospf processes`: clear all ospf routes.

`Note:`

#### C. OSPF Metric
(+) OSPF's metric is called cost, which is automatically calculated based on the bandwidth (speed) of the interface, and it is calculated by dividing a `reference bandwidth` value (100mbps by default) by the `interface's bandwidth`.
(+) The default reference bandwidth is 100 mbps
	(-) `Reference: 100mbps` / `Interface: 10mbps` = cost of 10.
	(-) `Reference: 100mbps` / `Interface: 100mbps` = cost of 1.
	(-) `Reference: 100mbps` / `Interface: 1000mbps` still = cost of 1
==> All value less than 1 will be converted to 1.

(+) Therefore, FastEthernet, Gigabit Ethernet, 10Gig Ethernet, etc. are equal and all have a cost of 1 by default. To check the cost of interface use `ip ospf interface f2/0`.
![[Pasted image 20240123111807.png]]
==> This is not efficient, so we should change the reference bandwidth for the network using `auto-cost reference bandwidth + <megabits-per-second>`.

![[Pasted image 20240123112005.png]]

(+) By doing this the cost of FastEthernet will be 1000 and the cost of Gig Ethernet is 100. It is recommended that we cahnge the reference bandwidth greater than the fastest links in the network (to allow for future upgrades). And should be configure for all router in the network.

(+) The OSPF cost to a destination is the total cost of the `outgoing/exit interface`, which is similar to `STP cost`.  And the cost to reach loopback interface is 1.
![[Pasted image 20240123112340.png]]

(+) Let's take a look of the routing table before and after changing the reference bandwidth.
![[Pasted image 20240123112547.png]]![[Pasted image 20240123112631.png]]
(+) We can see that before changing the reference bandwidth, there are 2 routes to `192.168.4.0/24`, one via R2 and one via R3. However, this is not efficient as the route via R3 goes through an FE interface which is not optimal as the route via R2. So after changing the reference bandwidth to 10000, the cost of FE and GE interface are different, hence there will be only 1 route to `192.168.4.0/24`.

(+) We can also manually configure the cost of the interface without changing the reference bandwidth using `ip ospf cost + <cost value>` on the wanted interface.
![[Pasted image 20240123113430.png | 500]]
(+) Another option to change the OSPF cost of an interface is to change the bandwidth using `bandwidth` command. As te formula to calculate OSPF cost is `reference bandwidth / interface bandwidth`.
(+) Although the bandwidth matches the interface speed by default, changing the interface bandwidth `doesnt actually change the speed at which the interface operate`.
(+) The bandwidth is just a value that is used to calculate OSPF cost, EIGRP metric, etc
(+) To change the speed at which the interface operates use the `speed` command.
(+) Because the bandwidth value is used in other calculation, it is not recommended to cahnge this value to alter the interface's OSPF cost. It is recommended that you change the reference bandwidth, and then use the `ip ospf cost` command to change the cost of individual interfaces if you want.

`Summary: There are 3 ways to modify the OSPF cost`
(+) Change the `reference bandwidth` using `auto-cost reference-bandwidth + <megabits-per-second>`.
(+) Manual configure the `cost` using `ip ospf cost + <cost>`.
(+) Change the `interface bandwidth` (not recommend) using `bandwidth + <kilobits-per-seconds>`
==> We can check the cost using `show ip ospf interface brief`

#### D. OSPF Neighbors
(+) Making sure that routers successfully becoe OSPF neighbors is the main task in configuring and troubleshooting OSPF.
(+) Once routers become neighbors, they automatically do the work of sharing network information, calculating routes.
(+) When OSPF is activated on an interface, the router starts sending `OSPF Hello` message out of the interface at regular intervals (determined by the `hello timer` by default `10s`) . These are used to introduce the router to potential OSPF neighbors.
(+) Hello message are multicast to `224.0.0.5` (RIP is `224.0.0.9` and EIGRP is `224.0.0.10`) and it is multicast to all OSPF routers.
(+) OSPF messages are encapsulated in an IP header, with an `value of 89` in the `protocol field` to identify it.

###### For router to become OSPF neighbors, it went through many states

###### 1. Down state
![[Pasted image 20240123115115.png | 600]]


###### 2. Init state
![[Pasted image 20240123115143.png | 600]]

###### 3. 2-way state
![[Pasted image 20240123115206.png | 600]]
![[Pasted image 20240123115254.png | 600]]

At this point, the 2 routers are already OSPF neighbors and are ready to share LSA.

###### 4. Exstart state
![[Pasted image 20240123115436.png | 600]]

###### 5. Exchange state
![[Pasted image 20240123115638.png | 600]]

###### 6. Loading state
![[Pasted image 20240123115745.png | 600]]

###### 7. Full state
![[Pasted image 20240123115837.png | 600]]

###### 8. Summary
(+) The first 3 states are steps to become OSPF neighbors, and the next 3 states are steps to exchange LSA, summarized as follows:

![[Pasted image 20240123120045.png | 600]]

(+) In each state, different OSPF message types are delivered, summarized as follows:
![[Pasted image 20240123120249.png | 600]]

(+) `show ip ospf neighbors`: to show information about ospf neighbors
(+) `show ip ospf interface g0/0`: to show information about a specific ospf configuration of an interface

###### E. Additional OSPF configuration
(+) We can active OSPF directly on an interface without using the `network` command using `ip ospf + <process id> area <area>` from a specific interface.

![[Pasted image 20240123121226.png]]
(+) We can active passive interface faster using `passive-interface default` to activate passive interface on all interfaces and then `no passive-interface + <int-id>` on ospf activated interface.
![[Pasted image 20240123121339.png]]

#### E. OSPF network types
(+) The OSPF `network types` refers to the type of connection between OSPF neighbors (Ethernet, etc.)
(+) There are three main OSPF network types:
	`Broadcast:` enabled by default on `Ethernet` and `Fiber Distributed Data Interfaces (FDDI)` interfaces.
	`Point-to-Point:` enabled by default on `Point to Point Protocol (PPP)` and `High-Level Data Link Control (HDLC)` interfacess.
	`Non-broadcast:` enabled by default on `Frame Relay` and `X.25` interfaces

###### Broadcast network types
(+) Routers `dynamically discover` neighbors by sending/listening for OSPF Hello messages using multicast address 224.0.0.5
(+) A `Designated Router (DR)` and `Backup Designated Router (BDR)` must be elected on each subnet (only DR if there are no OSPF neighbors).
(+) Routers which arent the DR or BDR become `DROther`.
![[Pasted image 20240123133755.png]]

###### The DR/DBR Election order of priority
(1) Highest `OSPF interface priority`. Which is by default 1 on all interfaces.
(2) Highest `OSPF Router ID`
==> The `First Place` becomes the DR for the subnet, the `Second Place` become the BDR.

(+) Use `show ip ospf int + <int-id>`: to view both the Router ID and the DR/BDR state of the router
![[Pasted image 20240123134117.png]]

(+) Therefore, to change the DR/BDR state of a router, we can change the ospf priority of that router using `ip ospf priority + <number>`

`NOTE THAT:` The DR/BDR election is `non-preemptive`, meaning that once DR/BDR are selected, they will keep their role until OSPF is reset or the interface fails or is shutdown.

(+) We can reset the OSPF configuration by using `clear ip ospf process`, however, not that this is not recommended for real network.
![[Pasted image 20240123135006.png]]

(+) Looking at the new BR/BDR State we know that `when the DR goes down, the BDR becomes the new DR. Then an election is helf for the next BDR`. Moreover, `DROthers (R3 and R5 in this subnet) will only move to the FULL state with the DR and BDR. The neighbor state with other DROthers will be 2-way`.

==> This means that in the broadcast network type, router will only form a full OSPF adjacency with the DR and BDR of the segment, therefore, will onl exchange LSAs with the DR and BDR. DROthers will not exchange LSAs with each other. This does not affect OSPF process as all routers will still have the same LSDB, but this reduces the amount of LSAs flooding the network as it will only receives LSAs from DR and BDR.

==> Messages sent to the DR/BDR are multicast using address `224.0.0.6`.

`Note`: So we need to remember that DR and BDR will form a FULL adjacency with ALL routers in the subnet. While DROthers will form a FULL adjacency only with the DR/BDR.
