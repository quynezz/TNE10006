#### A. Routing Information Protocol (RIP)
(+) Distance vector IGP (uses routing-by-rumor logic to learn/share routes).
(+) Uses hop count as its metric. One router = one hop (bandwidth is irrelevant)
(+) The `maximum hops is 15` (anything more than that is considered unreachable).
(+) RIP has three versions: `RIPv1 and RIPv2` used for IPv4. `RIPng` used for IPv6
(+) RIP uses two message types:
	(-) `Request`: to ask RIP-enabled neighbor routers to send their routing table.
	(-) `Response`: To send the local router's routing table to neighboring routers.
(+) By default, RIP-enabled routers will share their routing table every 30 seconds.

`Note`:
(+) `RIPv1` does not support VLSM, CIDR.
(+) `RIPv2` supports VLSM, CIDR, messages are multicast to 224.0.0.9

###### A1. Configure RIP
(+) `router rip`: enter router configuration.
(+) `version 2`: RIPv2
(+) `no auto-summary`: Automatically converse advertised network to classful network. Which needs to be disabled.
(+) `network 10.0.0.0`: form adjacencies with IP address in `10.0.0.0/8`. As this command is classful, we dont need to specify the mask.
(+) `network 171.16.0.0`: form adjacencies with IP address in `172.16.0.0/16`.
(+) `passive-interface g2/0`: tell the router to stop sending RIP advertisement out of specified interface, as there is no 
(+) `default-information originate`: share default route to RIP neighbor.
(+) `show ip protocols`: to show information about ip protocol.

`Note: How command network works`:
(+) The `network` command tells the router to:
	(-) Look for interfaces with an IP address that is in the specified range.
	(-) Active RIP on the interfaces that fall in the range
	(-) Form adjacencies with connected RIP neighbors
==> Note that `network` does not advertise the `classful IP address` in the `network command` to the neighbor routers. It advertise the `network prefix of the interface`. For example:
![[Pasted image 20240119130114.png | 400]]

(+) `network 10.0.0.0`: because the `network` command is `classful`, `10.0.0.0` is assumed to be `10.0.0.0/8`. R1 will look for any interfaces with an IP address that matches `10.0.0.0/8`
(+) `10.0.12.1` and `10.0.13.1` both match, so `RIP` is activated on `G0/0 and G1/0`. R1 will then form adjacencies with its neighbors R2 and R3.
(+) R1 advertises 10.0.12.0/30 and 10.0.13.0/30 (NOT 10.0.0.0/8) to its RIP neighbor.

(+) In the picture above, although there are no RIP neighbors connected to G2/0, R1 will continuously send RIP advertisement out of G2/0. This is unnecessary traffic, so G2/0 should be configured as `passive interface` using `passive-interface g2/0`. However, it is important to note that the router will continue to advertise the network prefix of the interface (172.16.1.0/28) to its RIP neighbors (R2, R3)
==> It is recommended to always use this command on interfaces which dont have any RIP neighbors.

(+) Should there be a default route in the topology, and we want to advertise this default route to R2 and R3 so that they can reach the internet as well we can use `default-information originate`.

#### B. Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP)
(+) Much faster than RIP in reacting to changes in the network.
(+) Does not have the 15 `hop-count` limit.
(+) Multicast using `224.0.0.10`.
(+) It is the only IGP that can perform `unequal-cost load-balancing` (by default it performs ECMP load-balancing over 4 paths like `RIP`)

###### B1. Configure EIGRP
(+) `router eigrp 1`: enable EIGRP on a router. The number `1` after this command is the `Autonomous System number (AS number)`. This number must match between routers, or they will not form an adjacency and share route information.
(+) `no auto-summary`: disable automatically classify subnet.
(+) `passive interface g2/0`: no neighbors on g2/0 so `passive interface`
(+) `network 10.0.0.0`: same as above. Activate eigrp in `10.0.0.0/8`.
(+) `network 172.16.1.0 0.0.0.15` or `network 172.16.1.14 255.255.255.255`: EIGRP uses a `wildcard mask` instead of a regular subnet mask.

`Note`:
(+) Wildcard masks is normal mask being inverted, and `0` in the wildcard mask means `must match` and `1` in the wildcard mask means `dont have to match`.
![[Pasted image 20240119133644.png]]

(+) Router ID order of priority:
	(-) Manual configuration.
	(-) Highest IP address on a looopback interface.
	(-) Highest IP address on a physical interface
==> To change this use `eigrp router-id + <id in 4 octec>`.

###### B2. EIGRP Metric
(+) By default, EIGRP uses `bandwidth` and `delay` to calculate metric.
```
([K1 * bandwidth + (K2 * bandwidth) / (256 - load) + K3 * delay] * [K5 / (reliability + K4)]) * 256. 
```
(+) The default `K` values are `K1, K3 = 1` `K2, K4, K5 = 0`
(+) We can simplify the formula like this: `metric = bandwidth + delay` ==> Bandwidth of the `slowest link `+ the delay of `all links`.

###### B3. EIGRP Terminology
(+) `Feasible Distance`: Is the current router's metric value to the route's destination (out of the interface).
![[Pasted image 20240119152135 1.png| 600]]
(+) `Reported Distance (Advertised Distance)`: The neighbor's metric value to the route's destination.
![[Pasted image 20240119152229 1.png| 600]]

(+) `Successor`: is the route with the lowest metric to the destination (the best route)
(+) `Feasible Successor`: an alternate route to the destination (not the best route) which meets the `feasibility condition`. `Feasibility condition` is achieved when a route's `reported distance` is lower than the `successor` route's `feasible distance`

`Note`:
(+) To identify these terminologies, we first identify the `Successor` using the `feasible distance`, then we observe the `reported distance` of the rest of the route to identify the `feasible successor`.
==> This method is used to prevent loops.

###### B4. EIGRP Unequal-Cost Load-Balancing
![[Pasted image 20240119153021 1.png]]

(+) `Variance 1` means only `Equal-cost multi-path (ECMP)` will be performed. This means a route's feasible distance must be equal to the successor route to be chosen as a load-balancing route. This means that there can be multiple successors
==> Therefore, with default setting, EIGRP does not perform `UECMP`
![[Pasted image 20240119153421 1.png]]

(+) In the above example, these routes can not be used to load balance as their FD is different. To fix this we can use the command `variance`.
(+) `variance + <n>`: this command means that the `feasible successor` route with an FD up to `nx` the `successor` route's FD can be used to load balance. Take the above picture as an example
```
With variance 2, if the FS's FD is lower than 2x the S's FD, then the FS can be used for load balancing. In this case 28672 * 2 = 57344 so 30976 is lower than 57344 => it can be used for load balance.
```

==> It is important to note that EIGRP will only perform `unequal-cost load-balancing` over `feasible successor` routes. If a route doesn't meet the feasibility condition. It will `NEVER` be selected for load-balancing, regardless of the variance.
