**1. Version - 4bits**: Identify the version of IP used. IPv4 = 4 (0100), IPv6 = 6 (0110)

**2. Internet Header Length (IHL) - 4 bits**: This field is used to indicate the total length of the header.

This will identify the length of the header in **4-byte increments**, meaning that if the value of this field is 5 then the length of IPv4 is 20 bytes.

The minimum value of IPv4 header is 20 bytes (5 in IHL) meaning 160 bits and the maximum value is 60 bytes meaning 480 bits  (15 in IHL).

**3. Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) field - 6 bits**: used for QoS (quality of service) and prioritize delay-sensitive data (streaming, video).

**4. Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) field - 2 bits**: provides end-to-end notification of network congestion without dropping packets. This is optional and will require both endpoints.

**5. Total Length Field - 16 bits**: Indicate the total length of the packet(L3 header + L4 segment). Measured in bytes. Minimum value of 20 bytes, maximum of 65535 bytes.
 
**6. Identification field - 16 bits**: If a packet is fragmented due to being too large, this field is used to identify which packet the fragment belongs to. 

Fragments of the same packet will have their own IPv4 header with the same value in this field.

Packets are fragmented if larger than the MTU (1500). 

`If there is no fragmentation`, this field will be used to uniquely identify itself from other packet using a generated value from the OS.

**7. Flag field - 3 bits**: used to control/identify fragments. 

Bit 0: Reserved, always set to 0

Bit 1: Don't Fragment (DF bit), used to indicate a packet that should not be fragmented.

Bit 2: More Fragments (MF bit), set to 1 if there are more fragments in the packet. Unfragmented packets will always have their MF bit set to 0.

**8. Fragment Offset field - 13 bits**: used to indicate the position of the fragment with in the original Unfragmented IP packet.

Allow fragmented packets to be reassembled even if the fragments arrive out of order.

**9. Time to live field - 8 bits**: A router will drop a packet with a TTL of 0, used to prevent infinite loops.

**10. Protocol field - 8 bits**: indicates the protocol of the encapsulated L4PDU, 6 is TCP, 17 is UDP, 1 is ICMP, 89 is OSPF.

**11. Header Checksum field - 16 bits**: A calculated checksum used to check for errors in the IPv4 header.

When a router receives a packet, it calculates the checksum of the header and compares it to the one in this field of header.

If they do not match the router will drop the packet.

**12. Source/Destination IP address 32 bits each**: used to indicate the address of the sender and receiver.

**Type of IPv4 Address**:

**Private Network**: 
- 10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255 (10.0.0.0/8)
- 172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 (172.16.0.0/12)
- 192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 (192.168.0.0/16)

**Loopback**: 127.0.0.1 

**Link-Local address**: 169.254.0.0 - 169.254.255.255

**Test-net address**: 192.0.2.0 - 192.0.2.255.
