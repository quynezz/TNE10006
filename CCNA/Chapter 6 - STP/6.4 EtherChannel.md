(+) Group multiple physical interface into one single interface working together.

(+) When the bandwidth of the interfaces connected to end hosts is greater than the bandwidth of the connection to the distribution switches, this is called `oversubscription`. Some `over subscription` is acceptable, but to much will cause congestion.

(+) If we attempt to fix this problem by connecting more interface between the two switches, it would not work as STP will prevent additional ports to function to prevent L2 loops.

==> The solution for this would be to merge these physical interfaces into one logical interface, hence ensure both redundancy and increased bandwidth.

#### A. EtherChannel
(+) EtherChannel groups multiple interfaces together to act as a single interface, and STP will treat this group as a single interface.
![[Pasted image 20240115145513.png]]
(+) Traffic using the `EtherChannel` will be load balanced among the physical interfaces in the group. An algorithm is used to determine which traffic will use which physical interface. Some otther names for `EtherChannel` are `Port Channel` and `Link Aggregation Group (LAG)`.

#### B. EtherChannel Load-Balancing
(+) EtherChannel load balances based on `flows`, a `flow` is a communication between two nodes in the network.
(+) Frames in the same flow will be forwarded using the same physical interface.
(+) If frames in the same flow were forwarded using different physical interfaces, some frames may arrive at the destination out of order, which can cause problems.

(+) We can change the inputs used in the interface selection calculation, some of the inputs are as follows:
	(-) Source MAC.
	(-) Destination MAC.
	(-) Sour and Dest MAC.
	(-) Source IP.
	(-) Destination IP.
	(-) Sour and Dest IP.

#### C. Configuration for EtherChannel
###### 1. Enable EtherChannel
(+) There are three methods of EtherChannel configuration on Cisco switches:
	(-) `Port Aggregation Protocol (PAgP)`: Cisco propretary protocol, dynamically negotiates the creation/maintenance of the EtherChannel.
	(-) `Link Aggregation Control Protocol (LACP)`: Industry standard protocol (IEEE 802.3ad), dynamically negotiates the creation/maintenance of the EtherChannel. (Like DTP does for trunks)
	(-) `Static EtherChannel`: A protocol isnt used to determine if an EtherChannel should be formed, interfaces are statically configured to form an EtherChannel
==> Up to 8 interfaces can be formed into a single EtherChannel (LACP allows up to 16, but only 8 will be active, the other 8 will be in standby mode, waiting for an active interface to fail).

###### 1a. PAgP Configuration
(+) `interface range g0/0-3`: 
(+) `channel-group 1 mode auto/desirable`: 
![[Pasted image 20240115160058.png | 600]]

![[Pasted image 20240115160234.png]]
###### 1b. LACP Configuration
(+) `interface range g0/0-3`
(+) `channel-group 1 mode active/passive`:

###### 1c. Static EtherChannel Configuration
(+) `interface range g0/0-3`:
(+) `channel-group 1 mode on`

==> Remember that the channel-group number` has to` match for member interfaces on the same switch, however, it `doesn't have` to match the channel-group number on the other switch (`channel-group 1` on `ASW1` can form an EtherChannel with `channel-group 2` on `DSW1`)

###### 1d. EtherChannel Load Balance
(+) `show etherchannel load-balance`: show EtherChannel information
![[Pasted image 20240115150808.png]]

(+) `port-channel load-balance src-dst-mac`: configure load balance
![[Pasted image 20240115150743.png]]

###### 1e. So a standard configuration for EtherChannel could be like
(+) `int range gi1/0/1-4`
(+) `channel-group 1 mode desirable`
(+) `interface port-channel 1`
(+) `switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q`
(+) `switchport mode trunk`
(+) `do show interfaces trunk`

`Note`
(+) Member interfaces must have matching configuration:
	(-) Same duplex (full/half)
	(-) Same Speed
	(-) Same switchport mode (access/trunk)
	(-) Same allowed VLANs/native VLAN (for trunk interfaces)
==> If an interface's configuration do not match the others, it will be excluded from the EtherChannel.

(+) The most useful command to verify EtherChannel configuration is `show etherchannel summary`
![[Pasted image 20240115161608.png]]

(+) Another command to use is `show etherchannel port-channel`
![[Pasted image 20240115161756.png]]


#### D. Layer 3 EtherChannel
(+) Modern network leans toward using L3 connection between switches, by that way, L2 loops would not be a problem as routerd port dont forward L2 broadcast so no L2 loops can be formed. 

(+) `int range gi0/0 - 3`
(+) `no switchport`: Make the interface L3 routed interface.
(+) `channel-group 1 mode active`: active etherchannel
(+) `int po1 and ip address ....`: assign IP address for EtherChannel
