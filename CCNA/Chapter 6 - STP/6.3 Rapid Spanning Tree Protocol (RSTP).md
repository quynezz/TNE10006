(+) RSTP is not a timer-based spanning tree algorithm like 802.1D. Therefore, RSTP offers an improvement over the 30 seconds or more that 802.1D takes to move a link to forwarding. The heart of the protocol is a new bridge-bridge handshake mechanism, which allows port to move directly to forwarding. 

#### A. Similarities between STP and RSTP
(+) RSTP serves the same purpose as STP, blocking specific ports to prevent Layer 2 loops.
(+) RSTP elects a root bridge with the same rules as STP
(+) RSTP elects root ports with the same rules as STP
(+) RSTP elects designated ports with the same rules as STP

#### B. Rapid Spanning Tree Protocol (RSTP)
###### 1. RSTP Cost
(+) The speed value of RSTP is difference from STP.

###### 2. RSTP Port States
(+) If a port is administratively disable (`shutdown` command) = `discarding` state. Or if a port is enabled but blocking traffic to preven Layer 2 loops = `discarding` state.

###### 3. RSTP Roles
(+) The `root port` remains unchanged in RSTP, meaning the port that is closest to the root bridge becomes the root port for the switch. The root bridge is the only switch that doesn't have a root port.
(+) The `designated port` role remains unchanged in RSTP, the port on a segment (collision domain) that sends the best `BPDU` is that segment's designated port (only one per segment).
(+) The `non-designated port` role is split into two separate roles in RSTP: the `alternate port` role and the `backup port` role.
	(-) The RSTP `alternate` port role is a discarding port that receives a superior BPDU from another switch. It functions as a `backup to the root port`. If the root port fails, the switch can immediately move its best `alternate` port to `forwarding`.

	(-) The RSTP `backup` port role is a discarding port that receives a superior BPDU from `another interface on the same switch`. This only happens when two interfaces are connected to the same collision domain (via a hub), but hub are not used in modern networks. It functions as a `backup for designated port`

#### C. Configure RSTP
(+) `spanning-tree mode + <rapid-pvst>`: enable RSTP.
(+) `show spanning-tree`: Show spanning-tree configuration.

#### D. RSTP BPDU

`Note:`
(+) In classic STP, only the root bridge originated BPDUs, and other switches just forwarded the BPDUs they receives. `However`, in RSTP, `ALL Switches` originate and send their own BPDUs from their designated port every hello time (2 seconds)
(+) RSTP also age the BPDU much more quickly, in classic STP, a switch waits `10 hello intervals (20 seconds)`. In rapid STP a switch considers a neighbor lost if it misses `3 BPDUs (6 seconds)`.

(+) RSTP distinguishes between three different `link types`:
	(-) `Edge`: a port that is connected to an end host. Moves directly to forwarding without negotiation.
	(-) `Point-to-Point`: a direct connection between two switches.
	(-) `Shared`: a connection to a hub. Must operate in half-duplex mode.

`Note`:
(+) In case when a root bridge is conencted to a hub using 2 interface, we need to elect a `backup port` for the two interfaces, as they are in the same collision domain. => Every port in unique collision domain of a root bridge is the designated port.

(+) If a switch is connected to a PC using full duplex, on packet tracer it will still show the link-type of that connected interface as `p2p` but it is in fact both `p2p` and `edge`.
