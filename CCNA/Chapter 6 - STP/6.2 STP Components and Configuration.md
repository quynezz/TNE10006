#### A. Spanning Tree Port States
![[Pasted image 20240102153934.png | 500]]

`(1) Blocking State`
    (-) Non-designated ports are in a **Blocking** state.
    (-)  Interfaces in a **Blocking** state are effectively disabled to prevent loops, therefore, it does not send or receive regular network traffic, and only receives STP BPDUs.
    (-) It does NOT forward STP BPDUs and does NOT learn MAC address.

`(2) Listenning State`
    (-) After Blocking state, interfaces with the Designated or Root role enter **Listening** state.
    (-) Only Designated or Root ports enter the Listening state.
    (-) The Listening state is 15 seconds long by default.
    (-) Interfaces in the Listening state ONLY forward/receive STP BPDUs, it does NOT send/receive regular traffic and it does NOT learn MAC address.

`(3) Learning State`
    (-) After the listening state, a Designated or Root port will enter the Learning state, which is 15 seconds long by default.
    (-) The Learning state **LEARNS** MAC address from regular traffic that arrives on the interface.

`(4) Forwarding State`
    (-) Root and Designated ports are in a Forwarding state if they are stable.
    (-) A port in the Forwarding state sends/receives BPDUs.
    (-) A port in the Forwarding state sends/receives normal traffic.
    (-) A port in the Forwarding state learns MAC address.

#### B. Spanning Tree Timers

![[Pasted image 20240102154904.png]]

(+) `Hello Timer` only send or forward BPDUs on the Designated port.

`NOTE`
(+) If another BPDU is received before the max age timer counts down to 0, the time will reset.

(+)If another BPDU is not received before timer counts down to 0, the swtich will reevaluate its STP choices, including root bridge, local root, designated port and so on. In order to detect network topology's error.

(+) If a non-designated port is selected to become a designated or root port to fix the error, it will transition **from the blocking state to the listening state(15 seconds), learning state(15 seconds), and the finally the forwading state**. Meaning that it can take **a total of 50 seconds** for a blocking interface to transition to forwading.

`==> Therefore, STP Max Age Timer is crucial for detecting error in network topology and issues appropriate measures to fix the error.`

#### C. STP Toolkit
###### 1. Portfast
(+) Switch even perform the `forward delay` to its end-point device, which is 30 seconds, this is to make absolutely sure that no loops will be form before forwarding on that interface. But only interface connecting to switch will be able to conduct a loop, there is no worries for connecting to end-point device right away.
(+) The solution for this is using `Portfast`, this allows a port to move immediately to `Forwarding State`, bypassing `Listening` and `Learning`. If used, it must be enable `only on ports connected to end hosts`. Or else it would cause a L2 loop.

(+) `spanning-tree portfast`: To enable portfast
(+) `spanning-tree portfast default`: To enable portfast on all access ports.

==> This option still presents a risk of other people accidentally configure the interface to a switch, to use this option securely we will use it in conjunction with `BPDU Guard`.

###### 2. BPDU Guard
(+) If an interface with `BPDU Guard` enabled receives a BPDU from another switch, the interface will be shut down to prevent a loop from forming.

(+) `spanning-tree bpduguard enable`: enable BPDU Guard
(+) `spanning-tree portfast bpduguard default`: enable BPDU Guard on all Portfast-enable interface.

###### 3. Root Guard and Loop Guard
(+) If `Root Guard` is enabled, even if it receives a superior BPDU (lower bridge ID) on that interface, the swtich will not accept the new switch as the root bridge. The interface will be disabled.
(+) if `Loop Guard` is enabled, even if the interface stops receiving BPDUs, it will not start forwarding. THe interface will be disabled.

#### D. STP Load-Balancing
(+) If there are multiple VLANs in the network, blocking the same interface in each VLAN is a waste of interface bandwith.
(+) We can disable different interface in different VLAN for STP Load-Balancingf
