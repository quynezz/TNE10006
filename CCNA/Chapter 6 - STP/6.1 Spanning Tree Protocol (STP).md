(+) As much as possible, we need to implement redundancy at any level.

#### A. Spanning Tree Protocol (STP)
(+) The Ethernet header doesn't have a TTL field. These broadcast frames will loop around the network indefinitely. If enough of these looped broadcasts accumulate in the network, the network will be too congested for legitimate traffic to use the network. This is called a `Broadcast storm`.

(+) Classic Spanning Tree Protocol is `IEEE 802.1D`, switches from all vendors run STP by default.
(+) `STP` prevents Layer 2 loops by placing redundant ports in a `blocking state`, essentially disabling the interface. These interfaces act as backups that can enter a forwarding state if an active (currently forwarding) interface fails.
(+) Interfaces in a `forwarding state `behave normally. They send and receive all normal traffic. Interfaces in a `blocking state` only send or receive STP messages (called `BPDUs = Bridge Protocol Data Units`).

==> By selecting which ports are `forwarding` and which ports are `blocking`, STP creates a single path to/from each point in the network. This prevents Layer 2 loops.

`There is a set process that STP uses to determine which ports should be forwarding and which should be blocking`.

`(1). Root Bridge Election:`
(+) **STP-enabled switches send/receive Hello BPDUs** out of all interface with the default timer of 2 seconds, if a switch receive a Hello BPDU on an interface, it knows that the interface is connected to another switch (Other devices do not use STP).
(+) Switches use one field in the STP BPDU, the **Bridge ID** to elect a root bridge for the network. **The switch with the lowest Bridge ID will win**, however, if the bridge priority is equal (it is set to 32768 by default), it will use the **MAC address as a tie-breaker**.

(+) Cisco switches use a version of STP called PVST(Per-VLAN SPanning Tree). Therefore, there is a VLAN ID in the Bridge ID to enable different VLAN instances to forwarding or blocking state.

(+) As the **Bridge priority + Extended system ID** is a single field of the bridge ID and the extended system ID is set(by the VLAN ID) hence can not be changed, we can only change the STP bridge priory in units of 4096. That is:

```
0, 4096, 8192, 12288, 16384, 20480,.....
```

  **`1.1`** When a switch is powered on, it assumes it is the root bridge and send Hello BPDUs to all other bridge in the network.

  **`1.2`** Switches will only give up its position if it receives a 'superior' BPDU (with a lower bridge ID).

  **`1.3`** Once the topology has converged and all switches agree on the root bridge, only the root bridge sends BPDUs.

  **`1.4`** Other switches in the network will forward BPDUs but will not generate their own original BPDUs.

  **`1.5`** With all the calculation done, **the root bridge is elected** and all interfaces on the root bridge are designated ports which means that they are in forwarding state.

`2. Root Port Selection`
(+) Each remaining switch will select **ONE** of its interface to be its **root port**. The interface with **the lowest root cost will be the root port** (root ports are also in a forwarding state).

Root cost is calculated based on the following:
```
10 Mbps => 100 STP cost (Ethernet)
100 Mbps => 19 STP cost (FastEthernet)
1 Gbps => 4 STP cost (Gigabit)
10 Gbps => 2 STP cost
```

The root port is selected based on 3 criteria:
- Lowest root cost.
- Lowest neighbor bridge ID. (combination of priority and MAC)
- Lowest neighbor port ID. 

`IT IS CRUCIAL TO REMEMBER THAT THE TWO TIE-BREAKER IS IN THE NEIGHBOR NOT LOCAL`

`3. Designated Port and Non-Designated Port Selection `
(+) Each remaining collision domain will select ONE interface to be a designated port and the other port in the collision domain will be non-designated.
- The Switch with the lowest root cost will make its port designated
- If the root cost is the same, the switch with the lower bridge ID will make its port designated.
- The other switch will make its port non-designated (blocking).
